# Installscripts 

This repo contains a mishmash of things for my own convenience. Among other
things:

- Configs

- Random scripts

- Ansible playbooks

### filebot.sh

Uses the program `filebot` to rename media files (movies, TV, anime) and
rearrange them in a nicer, neater directory structure. The variables inside the
script should be self-explanatory.

### nautilus-to-nemo.sh 

This script replaces Nautilus (Ubuntu's default file manager) with Nemo,
which is more configurable. Nemo will be installed and set as the default
file manager.

### themeInstall.sh

Installs the "ultra flat" theme from this repo.
